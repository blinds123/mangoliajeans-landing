## Phase 6: Copy Generation Rules

### Rule 1: Pain/Desire Priority = Page Position
- Most urgent pain → Above the fold
- Least urgent pain → Below testimonials

### Rule 2: Headlines Must Pass The "So What?" Test
Every headline must answer: "Why should I care?"

### Rule 3: Features → Benefits → Outcomes
- ❌ "Made with silk lining" (feature)
- ✅ "Feels soft against your skin" (benefit)
- ✅✅ "Dance all night without a single itch" (outcome)

### Rule 4: Use Their Language
Copy the exact words from reviews, Reddit threads, and customer feedback.

### Rule 5: The "Forehead Slap" Moment
Somewhere in the copy, the reader should think: "That's exactly how I feel!"
