### 2. PHASE 4: MEDIA & CULTURAL CONSUMPTION
- **Media Diet:** List the specific Substack newsletters, podcasts (Rogan vs. Ferriss), and influencers they follow.
- **Status Markers:** Do they value *The New Yorker* or *Reddit* threads?
- **Cultural Narratives:** Cross-reference their desires with trending "Main Character" or "Archive" narratives.

### 3. PHASE 7: TREND CONTEXTUALIZATION
- **"Suck/Scam" Research:** Search for "Why [market] sucks" and "Is [industry] a scam?" to find unfiltered pain points.
- **Differentiation:** Is the current brand truly a "New Opportunity" or just a derivative copy?

### 4. RESEARCH FRESHNESS MANDATE
- **LIVE DATA REQUIRED:** Use the browser to scrape Reddit, TikTok, and relevant forums.
- **DATE FILTER:** Prioritize content from the last 30 days.
- **CITATION:** Every insight must include the source URL and approximate date.
