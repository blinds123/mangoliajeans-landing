DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.

This file enforces the ENGAGE Framework for all copywriting tasks. The AI MUST read this file before generating any copy.

# THE ENGAGE COPYWRITING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY)

Every Feature and Secret MUST follow this exact 5-step narrative loop. 

## 1. E - EXPLOIT (The Headline / H3)
**Goal:** Disrupt a belief. Do NOT describe the feature.
**Rule:** The Headline MUST be the "Exploit".
**Bad:** "High Quality Leather"
**Good:** "Why Your Current Bag Is Failing You"

## 2. N - NARRATE (The Problem)
**Goal:** Tell a micro-story about the pain of the "Old Way".
**Structure:** Sensory details + emotional frustration.
**Example:** "You know the feeling - digging through a bottomless pit, panic rising as you can't find your keys..."

## 3. G - GIVE (The Solution)
**Goal:** Introduce the Feature as the specific antidote.
**Structure:** "Enter the [Feature Name]. We engineered..."

## 4. A - ATTACH (The Identity)
**Goal:** Link the feature to who they BECOME.
**Structure:** "This isn’t just a zipper, it’s peace of mind for the organized professional."

## 5. G - GUARANTEE (The Logic)
**Goal:** 1-sentence logical proof or promise.
**Structure:** "Tested for 10,000 cycles, so you never jam again."

# RESEARCH USAGE PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

1. **NEVER Invent:** You are a *journalist*, not a fiction writer.
2. **Traceability:** Every claim must come from `avatar_profile.json` or `strategy_brief.json`.
3. **The "So What?" Test:** If a sentence doesn't solve a specific pain point from the research, DELETE IT.

# NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (BANNED)
- NO "Delve", "Unlock", "Unleash", "Elevate".
- NO generic "Best in class quality".
- NO "Revolutionary solution".
- NO starting with "Introducing...". Start with the PAIN (Exploit).
