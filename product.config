# HERO FEATURES (4 Quick Points)
# -----------------------------------------------------
HERO_FEATURE_1="12.5oz Premium Denim"
HERO_FEATURE_2="Hand-Finished Vintage Wash"
HERO_FEATURE_3="Delicate Peony Embroidery"
HERO_FEATURE_4="30-Day Money Back Guarantee"

# -----------------------------------------------------
# MAIN FEATURES (FIBS FRAMEWORK)
# -----------------------------------------------------
FEATURE_HEADLINE_1="Authentic Vintage Wash"
FEATURE_HEADING_1="Each Pair Tells Its Own Story"
FEATURE_PARAGRAPH_1="Our signature hand-finished vintage wash creates that perfect lived-in look that feels like you've been wearing them for years. No two pairs are exactly alike - just like you, each pair has its own unique character. The kind of jeans that make people do a double-take and ask, 'Where did you get those?'"

FEATURE_HEADLINE_2="Artisanal Peony Embroidery"
FEATURE_HEADING_2="Hand-Crafted Details That Captivate"
FEATURE_PARAGRAPH_2="Delicate peony embroidery adds subtle sophistication - enough detail to catch the eye, understated enough to whisper rather than scream. Each flower is stitched into the fabric, not glued on top, ensuring it survives every wash cycle while staying vibrant. The artisanal touch that elevates these from regular jeans to wearable art."

FEATURE_HEADLINE_3="Premium Quality"
FEATURE_HEADING_3="The Same Quality as $200+ Designer Jeans"
FEATURE_PARAGRAPH_3="We use 12.5oz premium denim - the same weight as designer brands charging 3x more. Reinforced stitching at stress points. YKK hardware (the same as luxury brands). Pre-shrunk sanforized fabric that keeps its shape. We didn't cut corners on quality - we cut corners on the brand markup."

# -----------------------------------------------------
# FOUNDER STORY (EPIPHANY BRIDGE)
# -----------------------------------------------------
FOUNDER_SECTION_HEADING="Why We Refuse to Charge $650"
FOUNDER_BACKSTORY="I remember scrolling through Instagram, seeing those incredible bohemian jeans with the perfect vintage wash and delicate embroidery. I clicked through to buy them - then saw the price tag: $650."
FOUNDER_WALL="I couldn't justify spending that much on a single pair of jeans. But I also couldn't find anything similar at a reasonable price. It felt like beautiful, artisanal style was only available to the 1%."
FOUNDER_EPIPHANY="Then I realized: that $650 price tag included about $120 of actual denim and craftsmanship. The rest? Brand marketing, runway shows, and 'exclusivity' tax. What if I could keep the $120 worth of craftsmanship and skip the $530 ego tax?"
FOUNDER_PLAN="I spent 18 months sourcing the same premium denim, finding artisans who could replicate that perfect vintage wash, and building relationships with embroidery specialists. No boutiques. No runway shows. No celebrity endorsements."
FOUNDER_TRANSFORMATION="The result? Vintage wash bohemian jeans with peony embroidery at a price that actually makes sense. Same aesthetic. Same quality. Different price tag."
FOUNDER_INVITATION="Now thousands of women wear their Auralo jeans everywhere - from coffee shops to Coachella. They get the same compliments. They feel the same confidence. They just didn't have to empty their bank account to get it."
FOUNDER_IMAGE="images/founder/founder-01.webp"

# -----------------------------------------------------
# BIG DOMINO & SECRETS (3 SECRETS FRAMEWORK)
# -----------------------------------------------------
BIG_DOMINO="If I can help you see that luxury bohemian style doesn't require a luxury price tag, then you'll stop settling for boring jeans and start wearing clothes that make you feel like your authentic self."

SECRET_1_FALSE_BELIEF="You need to pay $650+ to get quality bohemian jeans"
SECRET_1_TRUTH="The $650 price tag is 80% brand markup, not quality"
SECRET_1_HEADLINE="The Luxury Price Myth"

SECRET_2_FALSE_BELIEF="Unique, artisanal jeans are only for special occasions"
SECRET_2_TRUTH="The best signature pieces work for everyday AND special moments"
SECRET_2_HEADLINE="The Occasion Fallacy"

SECRET_3_FALSE_BELIEF="I'm not cool enough to pull off bohemian style"
SECRET_3_TRUTH="Bohemian style is about authenticity, not being 'cool'"
SECRET_3_HEADLINE="The Imposter Syndrome Trap"

SECRET_PARAGRAPH_1="When you pay $650 for artisanal jeans, you're paying: $80 for premium denim, $30 for the vintage wash process, $10 for hand embroidery, and $530 for the brand name, marketing, and 'exclusivity.' We kept the first $120. We skipped the $530 luxury tax."
SECRET_PARAGRAPH_1_2="Same 12.5oz heavyweight denim. Same hand-finished wash. Same delicate embroidery. Different math."
SECRET_PARAGRAPH_2="You know that friend who only wears her 'nice jeans' on special occasions? Don't be her. The best signature pieces - the ones that make you feel like yourself - work for everything. Coffee runs. Date nights. Festival weekends. Lazy Sundays."
SECRET_PARAGRAPH_2_2="These jeans don't need a special occasion. They make every day feel like an occasion worth dressing for."
SECRET_PARAGRAPH_3="Bohemian style isn't about being the coolest person in the room. It's about wearing what feels authentic to you. It's about expressing your creative spirit through your clothes. It's about feeling like yourself, not like someone else's idea of 'cool.'"
SECRET_PARAGRAPH_3_2="If you're drawn to vintage wash denim and delicate embroidery, that's your style. Own it. You don't need permission to wear what makes you feel beautiful."
